Setting aside the obvious amazing intro deal of $30 for your first month of unlimited classes, The people and staff are just as amazing. I was so nervous and shy to start this new Yoga journey in fear or not being able to do poses correctly and feeling like an outsider, but every instructor made sure that wasn't the case. They were all so friendly and encouraging I never once felt intimidated. Every class made me feel confident and proud and it made going back more and more that much easier. I'm incredibly sad that I will be moving away and won't be able to take Hatch Yoga with me, but I will definitely be returning on days I am ever back in town. If you ever look at expanding up north, be sure to let me know :) Namaste.",

Every detail is finely tuned so that yogi and yogini of all levels of experience feel at home and get most out of their practice. \n\nThe instructors are knowledgeable, provide variations to accommodate practitioners of different levels, and create a nurturing environment. The class variety is outstanding: there are heated, warm, and non-heated classes that vary from restorative to vinyasa to arm balances. \n\nThirty minutes between classes allow the practitioners to come early (or leave late) and get into that first flow, meditate, or surrender into a relaxation pose. Being able to take a nice nap after restorative classes was a total game-changer for me ;) .\n\nAbove all else, everyone knows everybody by name. You are treated like family: members are initiated into the mysteries of proper alignment in a series of complimentary semi-private classes by the studio director herself. If you never had semi-private or private yoga classes, these will transform your practice. Proper alignment is the key to enjoying the full benefits of the poses, deepening your practice, and preventing injury.\n\nYoga is transformational, and Hatch Yoga is the perfect place for practice.",

Interestingly, both times I came, Mike was teaching the class and both times, when I walked in, he greeted everyone except me, like I was invisible! I felt bad the first time but chalked it up to an oversight. However, the second time it happened I was angry and that is why I'm posting the review. I ended up not signing in at the desk either time, although I know you are supposed to. My friend mentioned some instructors aren't that friendly or helpful but she likes the classes and its close to her house so she comes anyway. She also said that Mike was the owner so I was especially not impressed. Customer service is important even more for owners!\n\nThe classes were okay but I feel they are overpriced even if you buy on a promotion. I go to another yoga studio where we get corrections to our poses much more often, and I prefer it that way. Here, only a few students get corrections even though many people are doing wrong things.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place and don't plan on going back for any more free classes. I want to be treated well when I'm doing my yoga.\n\nUpdate: In response to the owner's reply:\n\nHello Lisa,\n\nThank you for your message. You are right in that I did not write the review immediately. I was reminded of my experiences when I got together with my friend yesterday for dinner. You said my review is unfair, I don't agree. For instance, according to her, when she signs in some instructors sometimes just make sure she scans the tag, they don't say hello, they just say thanks when the tag scans. Some instructors don't always say hello when she says hi to them, they just look at her to make sure the tag scans. She would never review your business because you know her and she doesn't want to make it awkward. It's not always friendly but she feels the classes are good for her health.\n\nIt sounds like you are coming up with reasons to excuse Mike for not greeting me when it would have been sufficient just to apologize for it and commit to it not happening again. I didn't \"bother\" to sign in at the desk because he was rude and I didn't want to speak with him. There were a fair amount of people at the free classes but the desk was not crowded either time when I got there and everyone except for me was acknowledged both times. I can't dismiss it as chance both times. Then you are commenting on the date of my review so as to discredit it. Unfortunately your response does not create any good faith, nor does it give me any motivation to return to the studio.",

Right breathing is what yoga instructor(Praveen) makes you practice through out the class which you will remember even after class.

If you like to be pushed or like to go at your own pace, there is an instructor to motivate you! Michelle and Dino both highly recommended! Also I like there is a non heated room with a perinatal trained instructor for modifications if you are pregnant. The two studios at the Mississauga branch are small, so come early to get your spot in the class! Only wish the rooms were bigger, but the place is very clean and non-intimidating.  ",

I never thought that hot yoga can help my body gain flexibility and help my lower back releases tension and tightness. I been practicing hot yoga at Infinite Yoga Studio for years and I'm glad I did. The community that they created is great. People are nice, they treat you well, I tried different classes and meet different teachers and every one got  different style and practices and mostly respectful to the students. They show modifications, show's how to use props and also they show the proper alignment towards poses. What I really like is they make you are feel welcome every time you come to the studio. They talked to you and pay attention if you have any questions on how to improve your poses. Everyone has a favourite teacher and classes to attend, they alternate teachers and I also go different days and time depending with my availability from work. But ever since I'm glad that Infinite Yoga is part of my community and through yoga it teaches me how to be more aware of my body.",

        "text": "On a delightful Saturday afternoon, I had the pleasure of attending a complementary class at Infinite Yoga in Mississauga. I have a rather thorough history with hot yoga, so I was excited to try a new studio.\nTo speak to the facility itself, it is mid sized with a good \"yoga vibe\". All I mean to say is that it's decorated well, and is somewhat calming. From what I saw, there are two large practice rooms and two change rooms. The mens change room has two small showers and enough space to get your business done, though they've opted for an open shelf rather than lockers. In their defence though, they're not the only studio that doesn't have lockers.\nThe class itself was A-OK. The instructor was a really welcoming lady, who kept the experience light hearted and jovial. The difficulty level of this particular class was more on the introductory side, (which I had no qualms with), but I've got a couple minor beefs. The first may be me nitpicking, but the way that the instructed coached our breathing seemed off. It felt like when the natural next breath was an inhale, she would advise an exhale, and vice versa. Am I high maintenance? Probably. Next up, I found that for a couple poses, the instruction lacked a bit of specificity that some great instructors have. The kind where you can go through the practice solely on vocal instruction and no peeping at your peers. Last up, is the temperature of the room. This is a matter of preference, but I'm definitely a HOT yoga fan. The heat and the humidity were on the lower end.\n\nWith all that being said, I'm generally happy with the experience, but I can't say that this studio stands out amoung other options. If it's convenient for you, go try it out.",
