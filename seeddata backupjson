While most times I feel the temperature is set at a constant, lately (maybe because of the summer days) it became really frustratingly hot to the point that my skin feels burning whenever in contact with the floor. I also noticed some instructors do adjust the thermostat accordingly during practice, which is much appreciated, but NOT all of them. As a student, I can't really say or do anything in such situations besides having to walk out of the room...",

After taking a bit of a break from yoga, I came back as an energy exchange student and the experience was fantastic! I really got to experience yoga on a new level and get more involved in the Iam Yoga community. I have met lots of wonderful like-minded people and my whole experience has lead me to join the Yoga Teacher training they offer :)\nI highly encourage everyone to give Iam yoga a chance and to also try to come in on off-peak hours.

    "description": "I joined Yyoga about 2 years ago from the fall season into spring for 7 months - I'm only writing a review now because of an issue I had recently redeeming my YRewards.  I frequented Yyoga about 3 or 4 times a week while a member and as such I got an email letting me know I had 2 free classes to use with an expiration date of 6 months.  I waited until the last minute to redeem these classes as I had joined another studio and the weekend I decided to go happened to be a long weekend - long story short they wouldn't make an exception or let me use one of my passes, and the person I spoke to on the phone said \"it was a free class anyway.\" This attitude brought back memories less than pleasant with Yyoga staff - they were on the pretentious side.  \nOn a positive note, I really enjoyed their fitness classes like spinning, high intensity interval training mixed with pilates (I think it was called YFit) and their yoga classes were great in teaching the fundamentals.  But, lately, I think there's been turnover and one of the classes I attended on one of the passes was one of the worst ones I had ever taken there.  I still consider myself a novice, but this particular class left me bored out of mind. \n Maybe it was just a one off and the teacher had a particular style that I just didn't get.\n\nI wrote an email to Yyoga Admin on their website and then I also responded to the email that sent me the complimentary passes.  Someone responded right away and added a pass to my account and I was quite pleased, but then I got another email saying that there was nothing they could do.  I'm still hesitant to redeem it given my recent experience taking a class there, dealing with front desk, and getting conflicting emails.",

I had met a friend there to take the class together (she had a 1 month pass), in front of the girl working the cash register I said to my fiend that I didn't  want to purchase a 1 month pass as I rearely come to yoga. The cashier hearing that did not point out to me that there was any expiration date on the pass.\n\nLong story short: I went to a class last week, the receptionist told me my class package had expired and if I wanted to take the class I needed to pay a drop in class fee. I asked to speak to the manager and nobody was there. She told me she would ask the manager to call me and I have not received a call back. I called again on Friday and left a message for the manager to call me, I received no call back. I tried again yesterday (Monday) and was told there was no one there, management would review my membership and if they decided to honour my membership they would call me, if they wouldn't honour it nobody would call me back. \nI called again today and an answering machine came on.\n\nTheir customer service is terrible, they will not honour your memberships and won't even call you back. It's a shame as I was happy enough with the place but I won't be going back as I feel ignored. It takes a long time to build trust with your clients and you can lose it in a minute.",

They offer many different types of classes which I enjoy, from relaxed to more upbeat options for when I'm feeling a little more vigorous. They offer different levels and options for poses in all classes and are consistent in the type of yoga offered depending on the class. They also offer herbal tea and cucumber water which I love. It is very clean and professional. I wish I could respond to some of the less favourable reviews on here because they really aren't fair. It is respectful to show up to class a little early (even 5-10min is fine) and remember to read the class description so you know what type of class to expect. The classes I've attended are described quite accurately and I really enjoy the variety. This is a great studio for the beginner or for someone a little deeper into their practice. If you want a little homier feel, I suggest visiting their Spadina location which is also top notch 👍🏼",

If you like feeling relaxed during your hot yoga practice and interacting with fellow human beings at reception who understand that life gets in the way sometimes, then DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION.\n\nMy friend and I arrived just before a yoga class and due to the unpredictability of life, we were not able to arrive 15 minutes prior to the class as suggested on the website. \n\nThe staff responded to our arrival with such disrespect. I've never been treated with such disrespect. At a yoga studio, nonetheless.\n\nThe girl working the front, and her fellow staff members chatting behind her, regarded my friend and I with disdain as we quickly signed waivers before getting ready for class. I apologized to the girl for being a few minutes late - class was at 7:15, we arrived to the front at 7:13. She shook her head with disapproval and asked if I was already changed. I nodded yes. She directed me to the lockers and I, now feeling the pressure to rush to my yoga practice, quickly misplaced my token. \n\nI rushed back to the desk asking for a new token and the girl responded with sheer disgust by shoving a token into my hand saying, \"You know what, you are already so late for your practice you better just go in\". \n\nAll I have to say is that it is extremely counter-intuitive for a YOGA STUDIO  (or anywhere  for that matter) to disrespect potential clients. I entered my yoga practice feeling guilty and upset like I had disappointed the studio by being their non-ideal client. I'll forever be regretting paying $20 for that drop-in session. \n\nThank goodness that the yoga instructor was very understanding of my tardiness. I only wish that the whole studio would embrace that same positive, warm energy. \n\nI should add that another girl working at the front grunted at my friend who, not knowing where to return her rented mat, tried to return the mat to the front desk. The girl angrily said, \"You return that back there\". We didn't even know what to do with that response. Where is 'back there'? Back where, exactly? \n\nHonestly, nothing could keep us there any longer after that.\n\nI will definitely be practicing yoga elsewhere in the future and spreading the news that this studio has horrible customer service.",

Really hard to relax before or after the class and get into the yoga mood here. I wish the teachers were more willing to confront bad behaviour.\nOVERALL: I really like this studio - the location, the schedule and most of all the teachers make it a winner its just too bad its chock full of stuck up and inconsiderate Queen Westers who can't live without their phone for 2 seconds.",

They were all so friendly and encouraging I never once felt intimidated. Every class made me feel confident and proud and it made going back more and more that much easier.

Every detail is finely tuned so that yogi and yogini of all levels of experience feel at home and get most out of their practice. \n\nThe instructors are knowledgeable, provide variations to accommodate practitioners of different levels, and create a nurturing environment. The class variety is outstanding: there are heated, warm, and non-heated classes that vary from restorative to vinyasa to arm balances. \n\nThirty minutes between classes allow the practitioners to come early (or leave late) and get into that first flow, meditate, or surrender into a relaxation pose. Being able to take a nice nap after restorative classes was a total game-changer for me ;) .\n\nAbove all else, everyone knows everybody by name. You are treated like family: members are initiated into the mysteries of proper alignment in a series of complimentary semi-private classes by the studio director herself. If you never had semi-private or private yoga classes, these will transform your practice. Proper alignment is the key to enjoying the full benefits of the poses, deepening your practice, and preventing injury.\n\nYoga is transformational, and Hatch Yoga is the perfect place for practice.",

        "text": "I've been here a few times with a friend (who comes more often) when they have had a promotion for a free class. Interestingly, both times I came, Mike was teaching the class and both times, when I walked in, he greeted everyone except me, like I was invisible! I felt bad the first time but chalked it up to an oversight. However, the second time it happened I was angry and that is why I'm posting the review. I ended up not signing in at the desk either time, although I know you are supposed to. My friend mentioned some instructors aren't that friendly or helpful but she likes the classes and its close to her house so she comes anyway. She also said that Mike was the owner so I was especially not impressed. Customer service is important even more for owners!\n\nThe classes were okay but I feel they are overpriced even if you buy on a promotion. I go to another yoga studio where we get corrections to our poses much more often, and I prefer it that way. Here, only a few students get corrections even though many people are doing wrong things.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place and don't plan on going back for any more free classes. I want to be treated well when I'm doing my yoga.\n\nUpdate: In response to the owner's reply:\n\nHello Lisa,\n\nThank you for your message. You are right in that I did not write the review immediately. I was reminded of my experiences when I got together with my friend yesterday for dinner. You said my review is unfair, I don't agree. For instance, according to her, when she signs in some instructors sometimes just make sure she scans the tag, they don't say hello, they just say thanks when the tag scans. Some instructors don't always say hello when she says hi to them, they just look at her to make sure the tag scans. She would never review your business because you know her and she doesn't want to make it awkward. It's not always friendly but she feels the classes are good for her health.\n\nIt sounds like you are coming up with reasons to excuse Mike for not greeting me when it would have been sufficient just to apologize for it and commit to it not happening again. I didn't \"bother\" to sign in at the desk because he was rude and I didn't want to speak with him. There were a fair amount of people at the free classes but the desk was not crowded either time when I got there and everyone except for me was acknowledged both times. I can't dismiss it as chance both times. Then you are commenting on the date of my review so as to discredit it. Unfortunately your response does not create any good faith, nor does it give me any motivation to return to the studio.",

If you searched the planet for the person least likely to practice yoga it would be me! Which is exactly the reason I love it. A studio designed for Bikram yoga from the front to the back, from the floor to the ceiling. Not some random cobbled together room with a couple space heaters and a vaporizer from Walmart, offering \"hot yoga\". This is the real deal. Classic 90, 60 for those with time restraints and a couple \"Yin\" classes for good measure. The Hot Inferno Pilates has to be experienced to be believed. Many do both. Or all three. A spotless well managed studio, qualified instructors that always make time to answer questions are the reasons it is consistently voted #1. In fact, if you are thinking of starting a business, you may want to use this one as a template.",

One of the important principle is not to stop breathing while performing asana’s which you hold for more counts, only after joining this studio I realised that I would hold my breath while focusing on some issue in daily life. Right breathing is what yoga instructor(Praveen) makes you practice through out the class which you will remember even after class. This studio offers practice schedule based on you needs and health conditions rather than a set of asana’s to be followed by all.\nIn short Yogatherapy4all makes sure every student inculcates yogic principles in daily life and be strong, peaceful, positive, happy 😊 and spread the same around you!!\nI am a happier person now :)\nKudos to amazing class and guru!!",

People are nice, they treat you well, I tried different classes and meet different teachers and every one got  different style and practices and mostly respectful to the students.

I have a rather thorough history with hot yoga, so I was excited to try a new studio.\nTo speak to the facility itself, it is mid sized with a good \"yoga vibe\". All I mean to say is that it's decorated well, and is somewhat calming. From what I saw, there are two large practice rooms and two change rooms. The mens change room has two small showers and enough space to get your business done, though they've opted for an open shelf rather than lockers. In their defence though, they're not the only studio that doesn't have lockers.\nThe class itself was A-OK. The instructor was a really welcoming lady, who kept the experience light hearted and jovial. The difficulty level of this particular class was more on the introductory side, (which I had no qualms with), but I've got a couple minor beefs. The first may be me nitpicking, but the way that the instructed coached our breathing seemed off. It felt like when the natural next breath was an inhale, she would advise an exhale, and vice versa. Am I high maintenance? Probably. Next up, I found that for a couple poses, the instruction lacked a bit of specificity that some great instructors have. The kind where you can go through the practice solely on vocal instruction and no peeping at your peers. Last up, is the temperature of the room. This is a matter of preference, but I'm definitely a HOT yoga fan. The heat and the humidity were on the lower end.\n\nWith all that being said, I'm generally happy with the experience, but I can't say that this studio stands out amoung other options. If it's convenient for you, go try it out.",

Our class was lead by Nienke who was a wonderful teacher -very thorough, and knowledgeable. We did Yin yoga -I have insomnia, and at the best of times cannot sleep -by the end of her class I was so relaxed and zen that I could have passed out happily! I can not wait to make this part of my weekly routine!",

Incia has created an atmosphere where all are welcome and children are encouraged to truly be themselves. My four year old loves attending Kids Yoga classes, and has taken part in previous PA Day and Summer Camps. My one year old also attends the Happy Minds Preschool and Kids Playgroups, and absolutely loves both. She gains the interaction she thrives for with other toddlers, and thoroughly enjoys all the sensory yoga activities, songs and books that are part of all the programs. We truly do love everything this sweet studio has to offer!",

Save yourself the time and money and watch a yoga video online, it would be a million times more engaging than the Friday night karma class at Kula Yoga Oakville. “Hot” yoga is a lie, the room was barely warm. I’m sure the yoga teacher is a nice woman, but the class was so boring. There was no variation, no levels or options proposed during the class. if youre a begginner in yoga, then this class is STILL WAY TOO SLOW AND EASY for you. Also, you couldn’t hear the music at all. I am not a certified yoga teacher by any means and I could have led a more dynamic and interesting class. It is no surprise I was one of only 5 people in the class that day. If you’re looking for a workout, a good yoga class, relaxing way to spend an hour or a pleasant experience, DEFINITELY SKIP KULA YOGA!!it didn’t help that The two receptionists on Friday karma class were not very welcoming",

It is hands down my favorite place to go for yoga and barre classes. Even when I moved away for university, I always made sure to attend a class when I was visiting home. \n\nI love Kula Oakville because they have great facilities, amazing teachers, and a very tranquil environment. Going into class and knowing that you can just be there in silence before and after class is so nice. This was the kind of etiquette I got used to because this was my first yoga studio, and the chatter that happens at other places has always been jarring in comparison. It's truly a place where you can leave everything behind and just be with yourself. \n\nMost of all I love the community feel you get here. They just gave me a phone call to let me know that the class I went to last week has been canceled. It's a personal touch of thoughtfulness like this that keeps me coming back.",

She proceeded to chew gum the entire 60 mins I was in treatment, nothing more unrelaxing then having someone chew and snap their the gum while I was there to relax. I specified I didn't want anything too deep, there were periods where I had to clench my teeth it was so painful. And this morning I woke up with a headache from the pressure she used.\nAnd to top it all off she didn't accept Greensheild!?! So now I have to make another trip into Bowmanville (we live 20 mins North of Bowmanville) to pay out of pocket until I can get reimbursed. The receptionist should have asked if I was paying with insurance and who my provider was, then inform me that this particular RMT didn't accept that insurance and I would have booked either with another RMT or another Spa.\nI use the Wellness Path as my backup when my regular RMT is booked up, I'm sad to say I will not be going back after yesterdays treatment.",

        "text": "I have been going to this yoga studio since 2012. A lot has changed in the past a few years but this is still one of my fav yoga studio in Toronto. (This studio previous is moksha Richmond hill, then it changed to my hot yoga studio, then changed to hot yoga wellness. Name change, owner changed.)\n\nThe studio is very good size, cozy but big enough. one room for both hot and regular temperature. Hold around up to 25 people. Rarely get too crowded. There is a mirror in the excise room, little decoration, very minimal. 4 large size shower and rarely get too busy either. Change room does not have locker but it was never needed. \n\nThis studio is always clean, does. It have strange smell some other yoga place. Sometime they use essential oil defused and I love it. \n\nStaff are very friendly despite there has been so many changes going on, there are a few Excellent teacher teach in this studio regularly. \n\nWhat I like the best is the temperature - this studio has best temperature for practice yoga, regular is warm, hot yoga is not too hot. In fact practice yoga in a external hot room is not best to our body - this studio make it just right. \n\nClass around 12$ - 20$ depends on drop in or buy class card. Membership is 135, couple is 175. (Membership is unlimited class). I normally buy family class card so I can share with families and, have flexible schedule. \n\nThe only thing I would I recommend - recent a year, there are students talking before and after class in the practice room - it shall and need to be a quiet practice, I hope staff and teacher will inform and educate new student on silence practice so it won’t interfere others practice or meditation before/after the class. Add some snack will also be nice. If there are some matt sort and small dry towel in the practice room to clean matt would be really nice as there is only a small rack outside to hang matt. \n\nOverall, if you looking for real yoga, great teacher, none fancy and none pretentious place for your yoga practice, this is the one.",

Staffs are amazingly friendly and the climbs change frequently. Plus the place is big enough so you won’t get bored even if you go 2-3 times a week.  Also people who climb there are usually really friendly so you can meet climbing buddy’s pretty easily",

I asked her why she was working, and was told that there no other staff scheduled. Her co-worker had stayed late to make sure she wasn't alone, and looked exhausted and harried. I couldn't believe it. The size of this gym, and one sick person was scheduled to supervise everybody?! I brought this up to the girl, and was told that management had been made aware but she didn't have any further info on when it would be resolved. She didn't sound particularly hopeful that it would be to me, though she was very professional in her responses. I was then told because my child was under 12, she could not climb higher than a certain height. Alright. The height, however, was not marked anywhere except one wall, and was more or less 1 foot lower than the actual routes?! I asked for clarification on how a 10 year old was supposed to recognize this, and apparently the staff and myself would be responsible for 'ensuring they stayed within the limits'. Given the amount of people there, this was an absolutely ridiculous limitation, and there was NO WAY that this poor girl and her exhausted colleague working the front desk (conveniently placed facing away from the marked wall where she could not keep an eye on the beginner area) could do so. I will NEVER bring my child here. I suggest anyone thinking of doing so seriously reconsider. I have been to True North Climbing, which is inconveniently further away, but always staffed sufficiently and I have always felt myself and child have been treated safely.",

It's a safe space where I can clear my head, meditate, connect to a friendly supportive yoga community in a family-like atmosphere. Thank you Liz for creating such a beautiful space for our community to enjoy. So many wonderful memories made! I especially love the many options of classes from Iyengar Yoga to SUP YOGA , Paddle boarding in the summer out on the lake, to Vinyasa, Hatha, Yin & Restorative Yoga and TRX. This studio has so many props, which is lovely to feel supported. They even use chairs, straps and blocks in most of the classes to open up deeper and relax into postures. The teachers are so experienced and you can tell they truly care about their student community.\n\nThere's so much happening here from the special guest events with Crystal Bowl Sound Healing Therapy, to Reiki and Massage to Kirtan and Sacred Music Evenings. \n\nThis place is so special. - Caitlan Carver",

My review is not based around that. \n\nThis studio is run by wonderful people, despite what some may be posting regarding the controversial post. I worked at this studio as an Energy Exchanger for a few months and honestly I wasn't even practicing yoga at the time. I just volunteered because I was going through an emotional time in my life and wanted to be surrounded by positive people, spend time in a peaceful space and do what I could to grow during a difficult time in my life. I loved the space, the environment and the people. Don is a very wonderful man. I never had the chance to meet Meg, but everyone only had great things to say about her. \n\nThey are very mindful and considerate of the fact that some people may need yoga in their lives, but cannot afford it. This is the only studio I have known to operate on a sliding scale so that everyone can feel the positive effects of yoga. To me, this is the embodiment of yoga. \n\nThey keep a very clean space, have fair prices and it is a wonderful community. I would recommend this studio to anyone. I would also recommend their Energy Exchange program to anyone who would like to practice yoga regularly but cannot afford it, and anyone who would like to surround themselves with like-minded individuals.",

The Red Tree studio is bright and the teachers are knowledgeable sometimes giving you suggestions and offering specific suggestions about  the poses.  The tone of the classes can be serious and quiet or they can be fun and energetic with upbeat music depending on the type of class. There are different classes posted on their website and most recently  Red Tree is offering warm Vinyasa flow classes which I am happy about because I enjoy this type of class as well.",

Let me explain and try to maintain my composure while doing so:\n- This place is located in a weirdly small little plaza right on a the busy road. Limited parking spots. There are some spots on the side road and back but you have to risk getting a ticket.\n- Their practice room is in a very small room in the basement. I repeat. In the basement. In. the. basement. with. no. windows. So, if you're claustrophobic; be prepared to meet your death.\n- Imagine 50 people cramped together in a little room in the basement, with the heat on. Each and every single person is sweating profusely. The Instructor repeatedly asks everyone to \"stick out their tongue and sigh and breathe out loudly\". So basically, you are breathing other people's vile breath and odour for the ENTIRE duration of the practice. If you like breathing in other people's breath/odour for 60 straight minutes while you bask in puddles of other people's sweat, then YOU WILL FEEL RIGHT AT HOME. Personally, I'd rather do my breathing exercises and poses in fresh air.\n- In order to avoid over-crowding, you have to go in at odd times (early on weekends)\n\nOverall, it's a great place. However, the over-crowding room with stinky people, dingy basement and an extremely limited parking space makes it a deal breaker for me. I hope you have a better experience than I did.",

Angie is so warm, friendly and knowledgeable and her conversation helped us feel at ease about the upcoming birth.  \n\nFrom the several late-night texts \"I think I might be in labour\" (I wasn't....) to the follow-up visits, Angie was so responsive, encouraging and positive.  We really appreciated her advice and recommendations.  It was great to have someone who was very familiar birth and babies suggest options for us to try as we navigated becoming parents.\n\nIt was fantastic to have Angie there on the day of our son's birth.  When she walked into our hospital room our nurses told us we were in good hands with Angie. Don was reassured by Angie's presence as she was able to suggest different things to try throughout labour and Angie was as much a coach for him as for me.  The two of them worked together to support me as Don knew what I needed and Angie knew possibilities for making labour more comfortable.  Thanks to Angie's help, I had a relatively quick labour and delivery.  Her experience at the Oakville hospital was also great because she knew the staff, told us what we could expect with different nurses and doctors and where everything was.  With Angie's support we had a fantastic birth experience.  \n\nWe will definitely call Angie again for our next kid!",

Due to some work and health issues, I was desperate to find something to help me cope with debilitating anxiety. I was extremely nervous to go my very first yoga class as I had visions of feeling awkward and looking like a complete fool in front of what I thought would all be \"perfect students\" who knew every pose and did each to perfection and a teacher that was just barking out poses. I couldn't have been more wrong.  The owner of the studio, Melinda, is one of the most compassionate people I have ever met and I felt welcome from the second I stepped foot in the studio.   The atmosphere is welcoming no matter what level of yoga you're at.  There are young people, middle-aged people and older people who come in;  it's awesome.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND GIVING THIS STUDIO A TRY;  it's one of the best things I've ever done for myself.  Melinda is not only kind, but is an amazing teacher who is patient and helpful.  The students that I have met have also been really nice and extremely welcoming.  I suffer with anxiety and Yoga at 7th Wave is actually helping me tremendously with that.  Thank you Melinda for guiding me with kindness to a new chapter in my life.  SO, TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T TRIED 7TH WAVE YOGA BECAUSE YOU'RE NERVOUS, PLEASE DON'T BE - I'M THE POSTER CHILD FOR FEELING THAT WAY, BUT I OVERCAME IT BECAUSE OF THE WAY MELINDA RUNS HER STUDIO.",

For the first time practicing yoga over 11 years I had to leave a mixed styles class on feb 27 930-11 am. I am usually very quiet about having my yoga teacher training, but I understand correct alignment cues and what may not be safe for the body. I felt as though she had no idea what she was teaching, there was no sequencing and the postures were- well it wasn't yoga, we bounced around all over the place. I quietly bowed out 40 mins in and will not be back. There was only one other student in the class so maybe that was an indicator, as a new person at the studio I had no idea. At another class I also left feeling as though there was something abrasive or negative lingering  in the air when the class was told to \"let go of their day\" quite a few times, but we seemed cool and ready to practice, maybe teach needed a meditation sesh. Before the teacher arrived the CD was skipping for 5 mins until a student turned it off. I usually don't leave reviews, but hey maybe it will help create a more positive yogic environment!\ncheers.",

We go to yoga classes  to learn , not to watch them that they are doing yoga.  Yoga instructor are too fast and they don't care if others can learn or do . She just keep her own stuff . They have to think  that some people are new and they can't do like others.  We go to learn , and if we knew how to do yoga , we will not go there and pay money . They say instructor is there to help u but reality is that they don't help u . They don't even show to how to do . U just have to follow them .",

I deeply regret because  I purchased 6 weeks pass instead of drop in. Be aware that they are very quick in taking your money and very slow in giving your money back , even when the instructor doesn't show up at the classes.   I went to another yoga studio with more professional standards , really experienced instructors, including substitute ones and more affordable prices. The extra driving is worth it.

I am new to this location, I traveled 1 hour to and from! and I am impressed! I witnessed and experienced the true meaning of practicing it regularly, love the medicinal part of yoga... what it does to your body. I want to thank  the teachers...I met Sarah, Linda, David, Hannah, Maria... your guidance is so important to us teaching step by step the proper way of deep breathing, the poses, and of course the caring attitude  it’s so encouraging! Their passion and compassion is tremendous! it’s  a nice ambience  and very close to the subway...teachers are sweet and welcoming.  it’s a total exercise of wellbeing and it’s true Yoga is medicine  for the soul and body.

The heat is strong and helps warming up your body for that incredible 90 min stretch. \n\nI consider myself to be in a good shape, this practice is by far the most challenging thing that I have ever done. Not only do you sweat, stretch, build strength and endurance, you also gain many health benefits, increased lung capacity, and tremendous mental strength.  In addition to the many many physical benefits, you also gain self esteem and learn to have a very positive outlook on things.\n\nThe instructors are great, encouraging and helpful.\n\nThere is free parking which is always a plus.  This is a great  studio for advanced and beginner practitioners alike.\nOverall: I'm excited to go back.",

I have been doing Pilates for about 13 years and have gone to numerous studios around the world, but once I found this studio and owner Andrea I can honestly say that this is one of the best. This private studio is truly a safe haven, where you come to release your worries and connect with your inner strength. Andrea is beyond qualified; she makes sure you are in good form and feel comfortable. She will challenge you when needed but never farther then they know you can handle. I recommend Uptown Pilates to anyone who wants to try Pilates. Andrea has an attention to detail that you will not find anywhere else and you will also get a great workout. Her place is more then just a Pilates studio, she will support you as well and for that I am forever grateful.",

This yoga studio is less about the thrills and trends of modern yoga and all about the raw fundamentals of yogasana as prescribed by the sutras of Patanjali.\n\nNo student is perfect and neither is the teacher. In my humble opinion, the mark of a fantastic teacher is greatly attributed to his/her openness and willingness to continuously evolve as a human being and as a practitioner. Where the student is constantly in learning mode, the teacher must also be able to switch from teaching to learning and back again. Few teachers (outside of the most 'advanced' Iyengar instructors) have this capacity and exhibit it the way in which I believe that Niren does.\n\nI would highly recommend Niren to anyone who is new to yogic practice or who has been practicing for years. That being said, you do not need my suggestion to discover this, you simply need to dedicate yourself to the practice and experience Niren's teaching for yourself.",

I've been to other studios since then, but Moksha (either North York or Thornhill locations that I have been to) have been distinctively different. I enjoy practicing at this studio so much because the staff and instructors are amazing! Every single instructor at Moksha is well trained and does a fabulous job providing instructions. This is one of the few studios where instructors take the time to observe each client and help ensure that they are doing the postures correctly. Also, Moksha is probably one of the few studios where you actually get to relax before and after class - there's a very good culture established amongst members to ensure they are respectful of each other's practice. The only downside with this location is that it gets crowded (specially in the evening and at night), and that there is limited free parking (and only at certain hours).",
